# Finite Field

Basically it's a different way to operate addition, subtractions, multiplication and division considering the existent numbers in vectors. Not all vectors can be Finite Field, they need have some properties. 

> F_{x} = {0,1,2, ... , x -1 } 

### For **Sum** and **Subtractions**:

' (12 + 843) % 60 = 15 ' 

> The sign % consider the rest of division, in the case rest the division by 60. 

### **Multiplication** and **Exponentiation**:

For F_{19}   

h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
